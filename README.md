# ⚡ Energy Consumption Forecasting using Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
### Time Series Analysis • Random Forest • XGBoost • RNN • LSTM

This project analyzes and forecasts **hourly energy consumption** for multiple US power companies.  
The dataset comes from Kaggle (Hourly Energy Consumption dataset), and the goal is to build a complete workflow:

- Data ingestion & merging  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering for time series  
- Holiday & seasonal analysis  
- Machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Deep learning models (RNN, LSTM)  
- Hyperparameter tuning  

This repository serves as an end-to-end time series forecasting project.
